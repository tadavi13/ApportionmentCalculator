The Apportionment Calculator program was created to improve workflow for a Sales Tax employee from Wells Fargo. The program's main benefit is improving the speed of aggregating numerous spreadsheet files of tax data from different sources. This is done through a streamlined spreadsheet file entry system. The program can aggregate any number of tax spreadsheet files (given they follow a simple header based format) and output this data in simple, readable format for the client. This can include either a spreadsheet file or a bar graph. These graphs detail apportionment values (in addition to the raw data) that are calculated based on the apportionment types selected by the client. This further improves workflow by preventing the need for an intermediary step for the client where they would have to import the spreadsheet file into a template just to recieve these values.
